# Ndlovu AI

Ndlovu AI is an offline-first modular AI framework. It serves as the foundation slab for all Oracode, Nkhudu Code, and future oracle projects.

## Agents
- **Nkhudu**: Core executor and system manager  
- **Kamara**: Strategist and oracle logic  
- **Assistant**: Supportive reasoning and memory handler

## Folder Structure
- `ndlovu_core/`: Foundation slab (core, registry, config)  
- `nkhudu_code/`: Core logic and workflows  
- `project_codes/`: Project modules and experiments  
- `oracode/`: Oracle-style reasoning modules  
- `data/`: Local memory and state

## CLI Usage
Run the CLI to interact with Ndlovu AI:

```bash
python cli.py
```

Type commands at the `ndlovu>` prompt. Use `exit` to shut down.

## Current Status
- Core CLI **is operational**  
- Agents **are registered and loaded**  
- Ready for integration of project bricks

## Roadmap
- **Add** Oracode modules  
- **Expand** project_codes  
- **Implement** offline-first intelligence  
- **Integrate** online functionality later
