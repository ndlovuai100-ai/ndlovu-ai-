# Base 44 Framework

Base 44 is an internal framework used to uniquely identify and link system components such as agents, workflows, prompts, and data objects.

The goal of Base 44 is to:
- standardize identification
- simplify orchestration
- enable traceability across systems

Base 44 acts as the connective tissue of Temple OS.
