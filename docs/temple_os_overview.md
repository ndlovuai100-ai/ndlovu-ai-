# Temple OS Overview

Temple OS is the internal operating system of Ndlovu AI Inc.

It is not a consumer product. It is the environment in which:
- AI agents are defined
- workflows are composed
- prompts are versioned
- systems are orchestrated

Temple OS enables consistency, reuse, and rapid iteration across projects.
